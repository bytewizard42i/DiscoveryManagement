## Session: February 10, 2026 (Evening)

### Context
First real build session after planning/research phase. Spy's feedback already received.

### Key Interactions

**John**: Create note file for Spy in grok folder and response template.
- **Action**: Created `docs/grok-data-structure-review/03-NOTE-FOR-SPY.md` and `04-SPY-RESPONSE-to-build-plan.md`
- **Outcome**: Spy filled in her response with Idaho IRCP details, med-mal specifics, and edge cases

**John**: Is AD-DEEP-DIVE-FOR-REVIEW.md no longer relevant? If so remove please.
- **Action**: Removed obsolete file (superseded by newer docs)

**John**: I goofed, let's take all data from Ohio and stick it in a file. I want Idaho and Idaho discovery law to be the primary focus.
- **Action**: Archived Ohio Grok data to `docs/reference/OHIO-GROK-PROMPT.md` and `OHIO-GROK-RESPONSE.md`. Revamped `BUILD_PLAN.md` to be Idaho-primary. Updated all docs.
- **Decision**: Jurisdiction rollout order locked: **Idaho → Ohio → Washington → Utah → California → New York**

**John**: Let's lock that order in. What should we work on first? Do you want to start making the folders for the compact smart contracts and begin making a skeleton?
- **Action**: Scaffolded `autodiscovery-contract/src/contracts/` with 4 skeleton Compact files:
  - `discovery-core.compact` — case lifecycle, step tracking
  - `jurisdiction-registry.compact` — on-chain rule pack registry
  - `compliance-proof.compact` — ZK attestation generation
  - `expert-witness.compact` — Phase 2 skeleton (med-mal experts)
- **Decision**: Used pragma `>= 0.16 && <= 0.18` (MCP recommended). Kept existing `counter.compact` (pragma `>= 0.19`) as reference.

### Commits
- `feat: create note for Spy + response template`
- `chore: remove obsolete deep dive doc`
- `refactor: archive Ohio data, restructure docs for Idaho-primary`
- `feat(contracts): scaffold AD smart contract structure + witness files`

## Session: February 11, 2026 (Early Morning)

### Context
Continuing from scaffold. Spy's feedback incorporated. TypeScript data model is the focus.

### Key Interactions

**John**: I hear there is an MCP that will allow our Windsurf to speak to another Windsurf instance, is this true?
- **Action**: Researched Agent-MCP (github.com/rinadelph/Agent-MCP) — multi-agent collaboration framework using MCP. Full deep dive conducted.
- **Outcome**: Comprehensive write-up created. Not adopted yet — bookmarked for future evaluation.

**John**: Let me think on it, please do a deep dive and shall we add it to PixyPi?
- **Action**: Created `AGENT_MCP_DEEP_DIVE.md` in PixyPi/myAlice and pushed. Covers architecture, setup for our family, pros/cons, open questions, and recommended adoption path.
- **Decision**: Don't rush. Test on Chuck with Cassie first if/when John decides to proceed.

**John**: Can you check out the ft bifrost bridge repo I just forked in GitHub?
- **Note**: GitHub MCP auth failing ("Bad credentials"). Worked around by fetching README directly via URL.
- **Action**: Reviewed `bytewizard42i/ft-bifrost-bridge_johns-copy`. It's a Bitcoin↔Cardano bridge by FluidTokens/ZkFold/Lantr using SPO consensus. Catalyst Fund 14 funded (739K ADA). AGPL licensed. In final dev phase.
- **Decision**: Not relevant to AutoDiscovery. Nice ecosystem reference fork. Parked.

**John**: I'm a little tired, can we pick up again tomorrow? In the meantime feel free to work on whatever part of ADL that you feel is appropriate.
- **Action**: Built the entire 6-entity TypeScript data model (Phase 0.3):
  - `enums.ts` — 11 enums covering all status types, categories, roles
  - `case.ts` — Case entity with disposition + appeal tracking (Spy's request)
  - `discovery-step.ts` — DiscoveryStep with supplementation + set number tracking
  - `jurisdiction-rule-pack.ts` — Typed RuleParams union, damages cap, statute of limitations
  - `document.ts` — Document tracking with PHI, Bates numbers, privilege log
  - `party.ts` — Party with attorney, expert, third-party support + UIDDA
  - `compliance-attestation.ts` — ZK proof metadata, selective disclosure, verification
  - `deadline.ts` — DeadlineSpec (relative), ComputedDeadline (absolute), overrides, holidays
  - `index.ts` — Barrel export wiring everything together
- **Spy feedback incorporated throughout**: warning→deadline→escalation flow, no Affidavit of Merit in Idaho, no county overrides, UIDDA under IRCP 45(j), disposition tracking for reform analysis, set number error prevention, insurance carrier audience

**John**: What law firms might be our first clients? Perhaps firms with a history of failure to comply? Could we compel them through a judge for a pilot program?
- **Action**: Developed comprehensive adoption strategy covering 4 client tiers (defense firms, plaintiff solos, insurance carriers, sanctioned firms), court-ordered pilot mechanism via IRCP Rule 16, network effect dynamics, bar association CLE channel, and go-to-market sequence.

**John**: Can you add an adoption strategy file and an interaction log?
- **Action**: Created `docs/ADOPTION_STRATEGY.md` and `docs/INTERACTION_LOG.md` (this file).
- **Decision**: Interaction log to be updated before each push going forward.

### Commits
- `feat(contracts): scaffold AD smart contract structure + witness files`
- `feat(types): implement 6-entity TypeScript data model — Phase 0.3 complete`
- `docs: adoption strategy + interaction log` *(this commit)*

### Decisions Made This Session
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Agent-MCP bookmarked, not adopted | Works but adds complexity + cost; current PixyPi system is sufficient for now |
| Bifrost Bridge parked | BTC↔Cardano bridge — not relevant to AD |
| GitHub MCP auth needs fix | PAT token not picked up by Windsurf; needs restart or token refresh |
| 6-entity model is DONE | All types strongly typed, Spy feedback incorporated, ready for rule pack + deadline engine |
| Adoption strategy: insurance carriers are the force multiplier | One carrier partnership = hundreds of firm adoptions |
| Court-ordered pilot via IRCP Rule 16 | Judges have case management authority to mandate compliance tools |

### Open Items for Next Session
- Create Idaho IRCP rule pack JSON (needs Spy validation)
- Resolve pragma/compiler version (test compilation)
- Build deadline computation engine
- Fix GitHub MCP PAT authentication
- Customer Analysis Matrix (Build Club homework) — incorporate adoption strategy data

**John**: What law firms might be our first clients? Perhaps firms with a history of failure to comply? Could we compel them through a judge for a pilot program?
- **Action**: Discussed 4 client tiers, court-ordered pilot via IRCP Rule 16, insurance carrier force multiplier, network effects, CLE channel
- **Decision**: Insurance carriers (MedPro, TheDoctorsGroup, MIEC) are the highest-leverage channel

**John**: Can you add an adoption strategy file and an interaction log?
- **Action**: Created `docs/ADOPTION_STRATEGY.md` and `docs/INTERACTION_LOG.md`
- **Decision**: Interaction log updated before each push going forward (standing protocol)

**John**: I really want to fix our connection to GitHub.
- **Action**: Diagnosed GitHub MCP auth. Token is set and valid (curl returns 200 from api.github.com). MCP still failing with "Bad credentials" — likely Windsurf not passing the env var to the MCP process. Needs Windsurf restart or MCP config fix.

**John**: I want to talk about automating discovery categorization and labeling — AI agents to auto-categorize, label, group, and dynamically assemble delivery packets from a data dump. Is this a reasonable goal?
- **Action**: Discussed feasibility in depth. Document classification, semantic search, and metadata extraction are production-ready. Privilege detection and jurisdiction-aware assembly are medium difficulty. The ZK-proven compliance proof layer is our unique differentiator vs. existing e-discovery tools (Relativity, Logikcull, Everlaw).
- **Decision**: Idea saved to `docs/Ai-for-parsing-of-data-dump.md` for future implementation. Not building now — focus stays on core platform first.

**John**: I'd like to work a little more. What is next? Please continue with our build plan as you see fit.
- **Action**: Researched actual Idaho IRCP rules from official source (isc.idaho.gov). Fetched and analyzed Rules 2.2, 26, 30, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, and 45(j). Built comprehensive `idaho-ircp.json` rule pack.
- **Key finding**: Idaho IRCP Rule 26(a) does NOT have FRCP-style mandatory initial disclosures — they're court-ordered via Rule 16 scheduling orders, not automatic. Flagged for Spy validation.
- **Rules documented**: 12 rules covering initial disclosures, interrogatories (40 max), production, depositions (no limit!), admissions (deemed admitted trap), expert disclosure, privilege log, supplementation, UIDDA subpoenas, physical examination, med-mal standard of care, and sanctions.
- **Also included**: Time computation (Rule 2.2), statute of limitations, damages cap ($509,013.28), comparative negligence, and a Spy validation checklist.

### Commits (continued)
- `docs: adoption strategy + interaction log`
- `docs: AI data dump parsing concept + interaction log update`
- `feat(rule-packs): Idaho IRCP rule pack — first jurisdiction data` *(this commit)*
